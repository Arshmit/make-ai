make-ai by Qubits

Introduction

make-ai is a website which helps users to make their own AI Model by dragging and dropping layers from Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) which connect together and make a brand new AI model. 

Setup
1. Install all dependencies of all modules:
pnpm install

2. Build all the code:
pnpm build

3. Start the app:
pnpm start

Technology Used

We used Python to write our layers. We got our front-end from a tech stack. The languages used for our front-end is Javascript and typescript. We used ReactJS to code our front end. We also have a chatbot which helps with clarifying any doubts a user might encounter while using our site. We used you.com's API in our chatbot as you.com has a human-like tone and we wanted our chatbot to feel as human as possible.
